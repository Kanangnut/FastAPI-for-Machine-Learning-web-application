# FastAPI-for-Machine-Learning-web-application
For this project i working on Lenovo 2in1 ideapad miix 520, window 10. So i just found Intel doesn't support CUDA drivers in any GPUs.
Although i using Google Colab instead, the awesome open-source python package developed by Abhishek Thakur.

Additionally detail, 12th generation Intel processors have an additional Gaussian and Neural Accelerator (GNA), which can help accelerate machine learning workloads.

Note: For troubleshooting of this project will update forward.
